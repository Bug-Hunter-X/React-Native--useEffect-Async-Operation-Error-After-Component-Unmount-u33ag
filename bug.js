This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an asynchronous operation inside. The problem arises when the component unmounts before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to a potential error because the component is trying to update its state after it has been unmounted.  This usually manifests as a warning message in the console that says something similar to:  `Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application.`

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('some_url');
    const data = await response.json();
    setData(data);
  };
  fetchData();
}, []);
```
